# Java Exercises: Arrays and Strings

## Introduction
This project includes Java programs that work with arrays and strings, developed as part of a university assignment. It covers operations on student grades, verb conjugations, string manipulations, and letter frequency counting.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Student Grades
This program stores student grades in an array and provides:
- Sorting and display of grades.
- Calculation of the average grade.
- Identification of maximum and minimum grades.
- A search function to count occurrences of a specific grade.

### Exercise 2: Verb Conjugation
This program takes a regular verb from the first group (ending in "er") and conjugates it in the present tense for all pronouns, with validation for correct verb endings.

### Exercise 3: String Operations
This menu-driven program allows users to:
- Input and display a string.
- Reverse the string.
- Count the number of words in the string.

### Exercise 4: Letter Occurrence Counter
This program counts the occurrences of each letter in a given text, ignoring case, and displays only the letters that appear at least once.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above.

## Usage
Each exercise can be run independently in a Java IDE or command line:
```bash
javac tp1/CompterLettres.java
java tp1.CompterLettres
