# 📡 Network Programming with Sockets in Java

This repository contains two practical exercises demonstrating network programming concepts in Java using sockets.

## 📁 **Exercise 1: Magic Number Game**

### 📝 **Description:**
A simple client-server game where players attempt to guess a secret number generated by the server.

- **Server:** Generates a random number between 0 and 100 and guides the player if their guess is too high or too low.
- **Client:** Connects to the server, sends guesses, and receives feedback.

### 🚀 **How to Run:**
1. Compile the files:
   ```bash
   javac ServeurNombreMagique.java ClientNombreMagique.java
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   java ServeurNombreMagique
   ```
3. Start the client:
   ```bash
   java ClientNombreMagique
   ```
4. Enter guesses until the correct number is found.

## 📁 **Exercise 2: Multi-client File Server**

### 📝 **Description:**
A multi-threaded server capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously for file retrieval.

- **Server:** Manages multiple clients using threads and serves requested files from a specific directory.
- **Client:** Requests a file from the server and saves it locally.

### 🚀 **How to Run:**
1. Create a directory named `fichiers` and add some files to it.
2. Compile the files:
   ```bash
   javac ServeurFichiers.java ClientFichiers.java
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   java ServeurFichiers
   ```
4. Start the client:
   ```bash
   java ClientFichiers
   ```
5. Enter the filename you want to download.
