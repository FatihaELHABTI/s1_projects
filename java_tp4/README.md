# Practical Activity: Java Streams, Collections, and Data Structures

## Overview

This project is a hands-on practical activity designed to explore various concepts in Java, focusing on Streams and Collections. The exercises aim to develop skills in data processing, manipulation of lists, maps, and sets, and solving real-world programming problems. Below is a summary of the exercises covered in this repository.

## Contents

### 1. **Streams**  
Exercises focus on leveraging Java Streams to perform data filtering, transformation, and aggregation:  
- Filter and transform lists of words based on conditions such as letter presence or length.  
- Convert strings to uppercase, reverse strings, or flatten them into characters.  
- Generate mappings like "word - index" and calculate word properties (e.g., length).  
- Demonstrate the use of operations like `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, and `reduce`.

### 2. **Employee Management (Streams with Objects)**  
Exercises involve managing an `ArrayList` of employees with attributes such as name, department, and salary. Operations include:  
- Calculating total salaries using `mapToDouble` and `sum`.  
- Sorting employees alphabetically by name.  
- Finding the employee with the lowest and highest salaries.  
- Filtering employees based on a salary threshold.  
- Reducing the list to specific results like concatenated employee names.

### 3. **Collections**  
#### **Lists (Products Management Application)**  
This exercise involves managing a list of `Produit` objects with attributes like `id`, `nom`, and `prix`. Operations include:  
- Adding, removing, and modifying products in an `ArrayList`.  
- Displaying the product list.  
- Searching for a product by its name.

#### **Maps (Student Grades Management)**  
Using a `HashMap` to manage student grades, with operations like:  
- Inserting, updating, and deleting grades.  
- Calculating average, maximum, and minimum grades.  
- Checking for specific grade values (e.g., 20).  
- Displaying the map using `forEach` and lambda expressions.

#### **Sets (Group Management)**  
Managing student names in two groups using `HashSet` with operations to:  
- Add and manage group members.  
- Calculate and display the union and intersection of the two sets.
